<h1>customer_web_application</h1>

Project completed during Per Scholas training, demonstrating knowledge of CRUD functionality using SpringMVC.

Possible improvements:

- addition of JUnit testing
- addition of Spring Security, as the log in here is hard coded with admin account for security, rather than dynamically set (which would be more ideal)
